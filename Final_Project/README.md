# Final Project

Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Project Github page set up - May 3

Functional check-off - May 10
 
Final Project Presentations (video watch party) - May 12

Final Project Documentation due - May 19

 
## Description
For this project, I built a security camera to make sure that my cat Bella eats her food. The camera is placed in front of Bella's bowl and it sends an image/video clip via text message to my phone when it detects Bella. The system allows me to have a better understanding of Bella eating habbit especially when I'm not at home.

## Deliverables

1. Documentation of design process
2. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
3. Video of someone using your project (or as safe a version of that as can be managed given social distancing)
4. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)

## Examples

This version of the class is very different, but it may be useful to see these.
